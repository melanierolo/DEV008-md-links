## Recursion

A recursive function is defined in terms of base cases and recursive steps.

In a base case, we compute the result immediately given the inputs to the function call.
In a recursive step, we compute the result with the help of one or more recursive calls to this same function, but with the inputs somehow reduced in size or complexity, closer to a base case.
Consider writing a function to compute factorial. We can define factorial in two different ways:
